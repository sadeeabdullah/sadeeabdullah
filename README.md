# 💬 About Me

Hello!👋 I'm Sadee Abdullah. I’m currently focused on **C programming** and actively working on **problem solving** to build strong fundamentals in logic and algorithms. I enjoy diving into challenges that sharpen my thinking, and I’ll soon be exploring **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to take things to the next level.
